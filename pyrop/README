This directory contains the code for a ROP compiler that uses pyvex to support multiple architectures.  The ROP compiler is
an attempt to make a usable, open source, multi-architecture ROP compile.  It is based on ROP compiler discussed in the paper
"Q: Exploit Hardening Made Easy" by Schwartz et al.

This ROP compiler is not:
0) complete
1) foolproof
2) allow for turing complete computation in ROP gadgets (sorry iPhone/grsecurity hackers)
1) bug free (please open issues if/when you find any bugs)

However, it is/does:
0) provide a few built-in mechanisms for spawning a shell
1) usable for most simple cases
2) open source
3) multi-architecture
4) use semantic based gadgets to find gadgets that syntax based gadget finders might miss
5) combine gadgets to synthesize missing ones

In short, this will not put an end to manual ROP compilation.  However, for the simple cases, it can generate useful ROP chains.
In the future, I will be working to expand its usefulness.  See the TODO file for what's planned (eventually).  If something is
not in the list that you want, add an issue for it and I'll add it (or a pull request implementing it).

Dependency list:
  pyvex
  archinfo
  cle (or pyelftools or radare2)
  z3 with python bindings
  pwntools (to run the examples and tests)

Setup:

pyvex
  - https://github.com/angr/pyvex
archinfo
  - https://github.com/angr/archinfo
cle
  - https://github.com/angr/cle
pyelftools
  - https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools
  - This package is only used as an alternative to cle, and is optional
  - FYI, the pyelftools package in pip repos is old
radare2
  - https://github.com/radare/radare2
  - This package is only used as an alternative to cle, and is optional
z3
  - https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
pwntools
  - Pwntools is a set of python libraries that ease the process of exploit development (process wrappers, gdb support, etc).
  - It's only needed to run the example scripts and test suite.  It's not used in the actual rop_compiler library.
  - It can be installed from: https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools
