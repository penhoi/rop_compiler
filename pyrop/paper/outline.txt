ROP Compiler

1) Intro and Motivation
    - what is ROP (why it matters)
    - why rop compiler
        - other existing tools, and their problems

2) Our tool
    - based off of Q
    a) Design
        1) gadget finder
        2) goal language
        3) gadget scheduler

3) Example exploits
    - How our compiler interacts with existing defenses (ASLR, w^x)
    - bof.py
    - rsync

4) Future work
    - gadget creation
    - bypassing other types of defenses (readactor, tasr, etc)
