            function - This goal attempts to build a ROP chain that will call the specified function.    The first parameter should be
                the name (or address) of the desired function.    Any arguments to the function are specified in the remaining parameters.
                Any number of function calls can be specified.
            shellcode_file - This goal reads shellcode from a file and then attempts to build a ROP chain to execute it.    The first
                parameter should be the filename of the file that contains the shellcode.    This goal must be the last one in the set of
                goals.
            shellcode_hex - This goal reads accepts shellcode as its first parameter and attempts to build a ROP chain to execute it.
                This goal must be the last one in the set of goals.
            shellcode - This goal is used to build a ROP chain to execute a set of shellcode that's already within the address space
                of the target program (but not necessarily with the right memory permissions).    This goal must be the last one in the
                set of goals.
            execve - This goal calls the function execve, while setting up the arguments appropriately to call the program specified
