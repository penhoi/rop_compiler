1) Can list the gadgets in a executable or library.
  - Done

2) Can obtain semantic meaning of gadgets.
  - Done

5) Develop attack goal language. This will involve parsing the input file from the user and resolving any given functions names.
  - Done

3) Can classify gadgets into the categories in Table 2 of the Q paper.

4) Can combine classified gadgets into useful building blocks, such as setting up function arguments.
  - pop rdi
  - pop rsi
  - pop rdx
  - pop rcx (function) / r10 (syscalls)
  - pop r8
  - pop r9

6) Can chain together gadgets in a POC program designed specifically for this purpose (i.e. it has perfect gadgets available).  The bof example I described earlier is what we're envisioning for this goal.
  - Setup autogen of rop

7) Can chain together gadgets for CTF challenges.  For this portion, we're going to modify a few exploits from external write ups for CTF challenges to use our ROP compiler.
  - Find and get exploit working for challenge
  - Setup autogen of rop
